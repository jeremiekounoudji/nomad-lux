# Banner Standardization Requirements

## Introduction

This specification outlines the requirements for standardizing all page banners across the Nomad Lux application to use a consistent Image + Overlay design pattern with black transparent overlays, replacing the current mix of gradient and image-based banners.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Banner Design Standardization

**User Story:** As a user, I want all page banners to have a consistent visual design, so that the application feels cohesive and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I visit any page with a banner THEN the banner SHALL use a background image with a black transparent overlay
2. WHEN I view a banner THEN the overlay SHALL use black color with appropriate transparency (e.g., `bg-black/60` or `bg-black/70`)
3. WHEN I see banner text THEN it SHALL be white color for optimal contrast against the dark overlay
4. WHEN I view banners on different pages THEN they SHALL maintain consistent styling patterns while having contextually appropriate background images

### Requirement 2: Responsive Banner Implementation

**User Story:** As a user on any device, I want banners to display properly and be readable, so that I can access page information regardless of screen size.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view a banner on mobile devices THEN it SHALL maintain proper proportions and readability
2. WHEN I view a banner on tablet or desktop THEN it SHALL scale appropriately with responsive padding and text sizes
3. WHEN I interact with banner elements THEN they SHALL be touch-friendly on mobile devices
4. WHEN the page loads THEN the banner image SHALL load efficiently without affecting page performance

### Requirement 3: Content Preservation

**User Story:** As a user, I want all existing banner functionality to remain intact, so that I don't lose any features during the design update.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view a banner THEN all existing text content SHALL be preserved and remain readable
2. WHEN I interact with banner buttons or controls THEN they SHALL function exactly as before
3. WHEN I view dynamic content in banners (like counts, user info) THEN it SHALL display correctly
4. WHEN I navigate between pages THEN banner transitions SHALL be smooth and consistent

### Requirement 4: Image Selection and Optimization

**User Story:** As a user, I want banner images to be relevant and high-quality, so that the visual experience enhances the page content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view a page banner THEN the background image SHALL be contextually relevant to the page content
2. WHEN banner images load THEN they SHALL be optimized for web performance
3. WHEN I view banners THEN images SHALL have appropriate resolution for different screen densities
4. WHEN images fail to load THEN there SHALL be appropriate fallback styling

### Requirement 5: Accessibility and Performance

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want banners to be accessible and performant, so that I can use the application effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use screen readers THEN banner content SHALL be properly accessible with appropriate ARIA labels
2. WHEN I view banners THEN text contrast SHALL meet WCAG accessibility standards
3. WHEN pages load THEN banner images SHALL not significantly impact page load times
4. WHEN I navigate with keyboard THEN banner interactive elements SHALL be properly focusable

### Requirement 6: Specific Page Implementations

**User Story:** As a user visiting different sections of the app, I want each page banner to reflect its specific purpose while maintaining design consistency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I visit the Notifications page THEN the banner SHALL use a notification-themed background image
2. WHEN I visit the Create Property page THEN the banner SHALL use a property/real estate themed background image
3. WHEN I visit My Listings page THEN the banner SHALL use a property management themed background image
