# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements comprehensive internationalization (i18n) support for the Nomad Lux platform, enabling users to experience the application in both English and French. The system will handle static UI text translation as well as dynamic backend data localization, including property types, amenities, and other content that originates from the database. The implementation will provide a seamless language switching experience while maintaining data consistency and performance.

3. WHEN a user switches languages THEN the system SHALL persist their language preference in local storage
4. WHEN a user returns to the platform THEN the system SHALL remember and apply their previously selected language preference
5. IF a user has no stored preference AND browser language is not French THEN the system SHALL default to English

### Requirement 2

5. WHEN viewing currency amounts THEN they SHALL be formatted according to the selected language locale

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want dynamic content from the backend like property types and amenities to be displayed in my selected language, so that I can understand all property-related information.

2. WHEN viewing property details THEN amenities (from amenities array) SHALL be displayed in the selected language
3. WHEN using search filters THEN all filter options including property types and amenities SHALL be displayed in the selected language
4. WHEN viewing notifications THEN title and message content SHALL be displayed in the selected language

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a scalable translation system, so that additional languages can be easily added in the future.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding new static text THEN developers SHALL use translation keys rather than hardcoded strings
2. WHEN the translation system loads THEN it SHALL support namespace organization for different feature areas
3. WHEN a translation key is missing THEN the system SHALL display the key name and log a warning for debugging
4. WHEN implementing new features THEN the translation system SHALL support interpolation for dynamic values
5. WHEN building the application THEN missing translations SHALL be detected and reported during the build process

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the language switch to work seamlessly across all features, so that my experience is consistent throughout the platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN switching languages on any page THEN the current page SHALL update without requiring a refresh
