# Review System Implementation Summary

## Database Schema and Backend Setup (Task 1.0)

### What was implemented:
The complete database infrastructure for the review system was successfully created and tested. This includes:

1. **Reviews Table**: Created a comprehensive reviews table with proper schema including rating, review text, relationships to users/properties/bookings, and review types.

2. **Database Functions**: Implemented three main RPC functions:
   - `create_review()`: Creates new reviews with comprehensive validation
   - `get_property_reviews()`: Retrieves reviews for properties with pagination
   - `get_user_reviews()`: Retrieves reviews for users (as guest or host)

3. **Automatic Triggers**: Created database triggers that automatically update user and property rating statistics whenever reviews are added, modified, or deleted.

4. **Validation System**: Implemented comprehensive validation including:
   - Rating must be 1-5 stars
   - Review text must be 10-1000 characters
   - Only completed bookings can be reviewed
   - Users can only review bookings they participated in
   - No duplicate reviews per booking and type
   - No self-reviews allowed

### How it works:
- When a user creates a review, the system validates all inputs and relationships
- The review is stored in the database with proper foreign key relationships
- Database triggers automatically update the rating statistics in the users and properties tables
- The system supports three review types: guest-to-host, host-to-guest, and property reviews
- All functions return structured JSON responses with success/error information

### Testing Results:
- Successfully tested review creation with sample data
- Verified that property ratings are automatically updated by triggers
- Confirmed that review retrieval functions work correctly with pagination
- All database constraints and validations are working as expected

The database backend is now ready for the frontend implementation to begin.

## Translation System Implementation (Task 2.0)

### What was implemented:
The complete translation system for the review functionality was successfully created and configured. This includes:

1. **Review Translation Files**: Created comprehensive English and French translation files (`review.json`) with all required keys for the review system.

2. **Common Translation Updates**: Added review-related keys to both English and French `common.json` files for shared functionality.

3. **i18n Configuration**: Updated the i18n configuration to include the review namespace, enabling proper translation loading.

4. **Blueprint Compliance**: All translation keys follow the established blueprint pattern using DOT format for cross-namespace calls.

### Translation Keys Structure:
- **Review-specific keys**: `review.createReview`, `review.rating.title`, `review.reviews.noReviews`, etc.
- **Common keys**: `common.buttons.submitReview`, `common.messages.reviewSubmitted`, `common.labels.verifiedStay`, etc.
- **Cross-namespace usage**: Proper DOT format implementation (e.g., `t('review.createReview')`, `t('common.buttons.submitReview')`)

### How it works:
- The translation system uses the custom translation store as per blueprint requirements
- Review components will use `useTranslation(['review', 'common'])` for proper namespace access
- All strings are externalized to translation files, preventing hardcoded text
- The system supports both English and French languages with proper fallbacks

### Testing Results:
- Successfully verified that translation keys follow the blueprint pattern
- Confirmed that the review namespace is properly loaded in the i18n configuration
- Translation switching between English and French is working correctly
- No hardcoded strings exist in review components (as none have been created yet)

The translation system is now ready for the review components to be implemented.
