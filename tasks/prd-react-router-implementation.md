# Product Requirements Document: React Router Implementation

## Introduction/Overview
The application currently faces navigation issues where the sidebar doesn't always correctly reflect the active route and update the main content area. This PRD outlines the implementation of React Router to create a robust, maintainable navigation system while preserving all existing page functionality.

## Goals
1. Implement React Router for reliable client-side navigation
2. Fix sidebar reactivity issues
3. Maintain all existing page functionality and layouts
4. Support browser back/forward navigation
5. Ensure protected routes for authenticated content
6. Preserve current URL structure

## User Stories
- As a user, I want the sidebar to accurately reflect my current location in the app
- As a user, I want smooth navigation between different sections without page reloads
- As a user, I want to use browser back/forward buttons to navigate through my history
- As a user, I want to remain on protected pages only when authenticated
- As a developer, I want clean separation between routing logic and page components

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Router Setup
1.1. Install and configure React Router v6
1.2. Create a root router configuration
1.3. Implement route definitions for all existing pages
1.4. Maintain current URL structure

### 2. Authentication Protection
2.1. Implement route guards for authenticated routes
2.2. Redirect unauthorized access to login page
2.3. Preserve post-login redirect to originally requested page

### 3. Layout Integration
3.1. Maintain MainLayout as the primary layout component
3.2. Implement nested routes within MainLayout
3.3. Preserve sidebar functionality and styling

### 4. Navigation Components
4.1. Update sidebar navigation to use React Router components
4.2. Implement active route highlighting
4.3. Support programmatic navigation when needed
4.4. Implement smooth page transitions using React Router's transition API
4.5. Redirect all invalid routes to home page

### 5. State Management
5.1. Integrate with existing Zustand stores
5.2. Preserve page-level state management
5.3. Handle navigation state in browser history

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)
1. Modifying existing page components
2. Changing current URL structure
3. Implementing deep linking
4. Adding query parameter handling
5. Adding new routes or pages
6. Modifying existing page state management
7. Adding loading states during navigation
8. Implementing scroll position management

## Technical Considerations
1. Use React Router v6 for its improved TypeScript support
2. Implement route configuration using `createBrowserRouter`
3. Use `<Outlet />` for nested route rendering
4. Leverage `useNavigate` and `useLocation` hooks for programmatic navigation
5. Implement `RouteGuard` component for auth protection
6. Use framer-motion for smooth page transitions
7. Configure catch-all route to redirect to home page

## Success Metrics
1. Sidebar correctly highlights active route 100% of the time
2. Browser back/forward navigation works as expected
3. Protected routes properly redirect unauthorized access
4. No regressions in existing page functionality
5. Preserved all current URL structures

## Implementation Steps
1. Install dependencies
2. Create router configuration
3. Implement route guards
4. Update MainLayout
5. Modify sidebar navigation
6. Test all routes
7. Verify browser navigation
8. Test authentication flows

## Open Questions
1. What duration should the page transitions be? (Recommend 300ms)
2. Should we add loading indicators during longer page loads?
3. Should we implement a fallback UI for route loading states?

## Dependencies
- react-router-dom: ^6.x
- Existing project dependencies

## Migration Considerations
- Implement changes gradually to minimize disruption
- Test thoroughly in development environment
- Plan for easy rollback if needed
