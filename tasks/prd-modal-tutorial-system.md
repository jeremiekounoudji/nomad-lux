# Product Requirements Document: Modal-Based Tutorial System

## Introduction/Overview

The Modal-Based Tutorial System is a comprehensive onboarding feature designed to guide new users through the core functionality of the Nomad Lux application. This tutorial will appear on the first visit to the homepage and provide step-by-step guidance through the essential features: booking properties, creating listings, managing personal bookings, and handling booking requests.

The tutorial addresses the common challenge of new users not understanding how to effectively use the platform, leading to reduced engagement and potential user churn. By providing clear, visual guidance, we aim to increase user confidence and platform adoption.

## Goals

1. **Reduce User Onboarding Friction**: Decrease the time it takes for new users to understand and start using the platform effectively
2. **Increase Feature Adoption**: Ensure users are aware of and know how to use all core platform features
3. **Improve User Retention**: Reduce early-stage user drop-off by providing clear guidance
4. **Enhance User Experience**: Create a smooth, professional onboarding experience that reflects the luxury nature of the platform
5. **Support Platform Growth**: Enable users to become active participants in both booking and hosting

## User Stories

1. **As a new user**, I want to understand how to book properties so that I can start using the platform for my travel needs
2. **As a new user**, I want to learn how to create and submit property listings so that I can become a host and earn income
3. **As a new user**, I want to know how to manage my own bookings so that I can track my travel plans and make changes when needed
4. **As a new user**, I want to understand how to handle booking requests so that I can effectively manage my property if I become a host
5. **As a user**, I want to be able to skip or close the tutorial if I'm already familiar with the platform
6. **As a user**, I want the option to never see the tutorial again so that it doesn't interfere with my regular usage

6. **Skip Rate**: Less than 20% of users skip the tutorial entirely

## Translation Requirements

### Translation Keys Structure
Following the established blueprint pattern, the tutorial will use these translation namespaces:

```json
{
  "tutorial": {
    "title": "Welcome to Nomad Lux",
    "skipButton": "Skip Tutorial",
    "closeButton": "Close",
    "neverShowAgain": "Never show again",
    "navigation": {
      "previous": "Previous",
      "next": "Next",
      "finish": "Get Started"
    },
    "progress": {
      "step": "Step {{current}} of {{total}}"
    },
    "steps": {
      "booking": {
        "title": "Find and Book Properties",
        "description": "Discover luxury properties and book your perfect stay"
      },
      "creation": {
        "title": "Create Your Property Listing",
        "description": "Submit your property for admin approval"
      },
      "management": {
        "title": "Manage Your Bookings",
        "description": "Track and manage your travel bookings"
      },
      "requests": {
        "title": "Handle Booking Requests",
        "description": "Approve or reject incoming booking requests"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Implementation Pattern
- Use `useTranslation(['tutorial', 'common'])` in tutorial components
- Follow DOT format: `t('tutorial.steps.booking.title')`
- Add keys to both `en` and `fr` translation files
- Ensure all text is translatable with no hardcoded strings

## Open Questions

1. **Image Assets**: Who will create the tutorial screenshots and visual highlights?
2. **Content Approval**: Who needs to review and approve the tutorial content and descriptions?
3. **A/B Testing**: Should we implement A/B testing to optimize tutorial content and flow?
4. **Analytics Events**: What specific analytics events should we track for tutorial interactions?
5. **Analytics Events**: What specific analytics events should we track for tutorial interactions?
6. **Mobile Optimization**: Should the tutorial have different content or layout for mobile vs desktop?
7. **Accessibility Testing**: Who will conduct accessibility testing to ensure the tutorial meets WCAG guidelines?
