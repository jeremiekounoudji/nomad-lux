# Product Requirements Document: OpenStreetMap Integration for Nomad Lux

## Introduction/Overview

This feature adds interactive map functionality throughout the Nomad Lux platform using OpenStreetMap and Leaflet to display property locations, enhance search capabilities, and improve user experience when browsing and booking accommodations. The implementation will provide free, reliable mapping without modifying existing components.

### Problem Statement
Currently, the application shows static map placeholders and lacks interactive location-based features that would help users better understand property locations, search by geographic area, and visualize property distributions.

### Goal
Integrate OpenStreetMap-based interactive maps to enhance property discovery, location visualization, and geographic search capabilities while maintaining the existing UI/UX patterns.

## Goals

1. **Interactive Location Visualization**: Replace static map placeholders with interactive OpenStreetMap displays
2. **Enhanced Search Experience**: Enable map-based property search with toggle between list and map views
3. **Geographic Property Discovery**: Allow users to explore properties by location and proximity
4. **Mobile-Optimized Navigation**: Provide touch-friendly map controls for mobile users
5. **Performance Optimization**: Implement lazy loading and efficient rendering for smooth user experience

## User Stories

1. **As a property seeker**, I want to see property locations on an interactive map so that I can understand the neighborhood and proximity to landmarks.

2. **As a traveler**, I want to toggle between list and map view on search results so that I can choose my preferred browsing method.

3. **As a mobile user**, I want touch-optimized map controls so that I can easily navigate maps on my device.

4. **As a location-conscious traveler**, I want to see property prices, thumbnails, and ratings directly on map markers so that I can quickly compare options.

5. **As a property browser**, I want to see clustered markers when viewing multiple properties so that the map remains clean and navigable.

6. **As a convenience-focused user**, I want to get directions to properties from the map so that I can plan my travel route.

7. **As an admin user**, I want to see property locations on management pages so that I can verify and manage property geographic data.

## Functional Requirements

22. **F22**: Optimize bundle size by using dynamic imports for map libraries
23. **F23**: Cache map tiles for improved performance

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **Modifying Existing Components**: No changes to existing pages, components, or functionality
2. **Offline Map Support**: Not implementing offline map capabilities in initial version
3. **Real-time Location Tracking**: No GPS tracking or real-time location features
4. **Advanced Routing**: No complex route planning beyond basic directions
5. **Custom Tile Servers**: Using standard OpenStreetMap tiles only
6. **User Location Sharing**: No sharing of user's current location with hosts
7. **Geofencing Features**: No location-based notifications or alerts
8. **Alternative Map Providers**: Focusing solely on OpenStreetMap integration

## Technical Considerations

### Dependencies
- **Leaflet.js**: Core mapping library (~39KB gzipped)
- **React-Leaflet**: React wrapper for Leaflet integration
- **Leaflet.markercluster**: For clustering multiple property markers
- **Leaflet-routing-machine**: For directions functionality

### Integration Points
- **Zustand Stores**: Integrate with existing propertyStore, searchFeedStore
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety for all map-related interfaces
- **Tailwind CSS**: Consistent styling with existing design system
- **Hero UI**: Use existing modal and button components for map interactions

### Performance Considerations
- Lazy load map components using React.lazy()
- Dynamic imports for Leaflet libraries to reduce initial bundle size
- Implement viewport-based marker loading for large property sets
- Use memo() for marker components to prevent unnecessary re-renders

### Mobile Optimization
- Touch-friendly zoom controls
- Responsive marker sizes
- Optimized tile loading for mobile networks
- Gesture handling for map interactions

## Design Considerations

### Map Styling
- Use OpenStreetMap standard tiles with custom marker styling
- Implement dark/light mode support to match application theme
- Custom property markers with price and image overlays
- Cluster styling consistent with application design language

### UI Integration
- Toggle buttons styled with Hero UI components
- Map overlays using existing modal patterns
- Loading states consistent with PropertyCardSkeleton
- Error states following application error handling patterns

### Component Architecture
```

## Open Questions

1. **Marker Density**: What's the maximum number of properties to show on a single map view before implementing pagination?

2. **Zoom Levels**: What are the appropriate default and maximum zoom levels for different map contexts?

3. **Directions Integration**: Should directions open in the device's default map app or display within the application?

4. **Cache Strategy**: How long should map tiles and property location data be cached?

5. **Error Recovery**: Should there be a fallback to static images if map loading fails completely?

6. **Admin Permissions**: Do different admin roles need different map features or viewing permissions?
