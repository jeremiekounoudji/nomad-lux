# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Admin Booking Management Integration

---

## 1. Introduction/Overview

This feature will integrate comprehensive booking listings into the existing admin panel, allowing administrators to view all platform bookings across different statuses with associated payment records. The solution will enhance the existing admin UI components rather than creating new ones, providing a centralized view for booking oversight and payment management.

**Problem Statement**: Administrators currently lack a unified view of all platform bookings and their associated payment records, making it difficult to monitor booking activity, process refunds, and oversee the platform's booking ecosystem.

**Goal**: Provide administrators with a comprehensive, status-based booking management interface that integrates with existing payment records and maintains the current admin panel design patterns.

## 2. Goals

1. **Centralized Booking Oversight**: Enable admins to view all platform bookings in a single interface
2. **Status-Based Organization**: Provide clear categorization of bookings by their current status
3. **Payment Integration**: Display basic payment information with detailed records accessible via modals
4. **Administrative Actions**: Allow admins to process refunds and view detailed booking information
5. **Enhanced User Experience**: Leverage existing admin UI components for consistency and familiarity

## 3. User Stories

**As an administrator, I want to:**

1. View all platform bookings organized by status so I can monitor booking activity across the platform
2. See basic booking information (guest, property, dates, amount) in list view for quick scanning
3. Access detailed payment records through modals to investigate payment issues or process refunds
4. Process refunds for cancelled or disputed bookings to handle customer service issues
5. Search and filter bookings using multiple criteria to find specific bookings quickly
6. Navigate between different booking statuses easily to focus on relevant booking categories

## 4. Functional Requirements

### 4.1 Data Access & Display
1. **System-wide Booking Access**: Display all bookings across the entire platform regardless of property or host
2. **Status-based Filtering**: Support all existing booking statuses:
   - `pending` - New booking requests awaiting approval
   - `confirmed` - Approved bookings with successful payment
   - `cancelled` - Cancelled bookings by guest or host
   - `completed` - Successfully completed stays
   - `rejected` - Declined booking requests
   - `accepted-and-waiting-for-payment` - Approved but payment pending
   - `payment-failed` - Bookings with failed payment attempts

### 4.2 Booking List View
3. **Basic Information Display**: Show essential booking details in list format:
   - Booking ID and creation date
   - Guest name and contact information
   - Property title and location
   - Check-in/check-out dates and guest count
   - Total amount and currency
   - Current booking status
   - Payment status indicator

### 4.3 Payment Records Integration
4. **Payment Information Access**:
   - Display basic payment status in list view
   - Show detailed payment records in modal overlay including:
     - Payment method and provider
     - Amount breakdown (base amount, fees, net amount)
     - Payment status and timestamps
     - Refund information if applicable
     - Payout status and dates

### 4.4 Administrative Actions
5. **Refund Processing**: Enable admins to:
   - View refund eligibility for cancelled/disputed bookings
   - Process full or partial refunds with reason tracking
   - Update refund status and amounts in payment records

6. **Read-only Booking Management**: Provide view-only access to booking details without approval/rejection capabilities

### 4.5 Search & Filtering
7. **Multi-criteria Filtering**:
   - Text search across guest names, host names, booking IDs, and property titles
   - Date range filtering for booking creation, check-in, or check-out dates
   - Amount range filtering for total booking value
   - Location-based filtering by city or country
   - Combined filter persistence across status tab changes

### 4.6 Pagination & Performance
8. **Standard Pagination**: Implement 10 bookings per page with pagination controls
9. **Loading States**: Display appropriate loading indicators during data fetching
10. **Error Handling**: Show user-friendly error messages with retry options

---

## 5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **Booking Approval/Rejection**: Admins cannot approve or reject bookings (host-only function)
2. **Real-time Updates**: No automatic refresh or live notifications for booking changes
3. **New UI Component Creation**: Will enhance existing admin components rather than building new ones
4. **Booking Creation**: Admins cannot create new bookings on behalf of users
5. **Host Communication**: Direct messaging between admins and hosts/guests
6. **Booking Modification**: Changing booking dates, guest counts, or pricing

---

## 6. Design Considerations

### 6.1 UI Component Reuse
- **Enhance Existing Components**: Build upon current `BookingManagement.tsx` admin component
- **Modal Integration**: Utilize existing admin modal patterns for payment record details
- **Table Structure**: Leverage current admin table layouts and styling
- **Status Badges**: Use existing HeroUI Chip components for status display

### 6.2 Data Architecture
- **Hook Enhancement**: Extend `useBookingManagement` hook with admin-specific functions
- **Store Integration**: Utilize existing `bookingStore` for state management
- **Database Queries**: Follow established patterns from `MyBookingsPage.tsx` and `BookingRequestsPage.tsx`

---

## 7. Technical Considerations

### 7.1 Database Integration
- **Supabase MCP Tool Usage**: Use established MCP Supabase tools for all database operations
- **Query Optimization**: Implement efficient joins between bookings, users, properties, and payment_records tables
- **Pagination Implementation**: Server-side pagination to handle large datasets

### 7.2 Performance Requirements
- **Loading Time**: Initial booking list should load within 3 seconds
- **Search Response**: Filter/search results should appear within 1 second
- **Modal Loading**: Payment record details should load within 2 seconds

### 7.3 Data Security
- **Admin Authentication**: Verify admin role before displaying booking data
- **Sensitive Data Handling**: Mask sensitive payment information appropriately
- **Audit Logging**: Log admin actions for refund processing and data access
